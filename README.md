# chess_scrape

This is a small side project in which I scrape all of my games on chess.com to get deeper stats like "what are my average number of moves per game in which I win and which I lose?", "What % of the time do I win by timeout vs. win by checkmate. Does this percentage change as my ELO does?", "What day of the week do I play the most chess?" 

Sidenote: My ELO is a work in progress.
