### Summary 
This is a small side project in which I scrape all of my games on chess.com to get deeper stats like "What are my average number of moves per game in which I win and which I lose?", "What percent of the time do I win by timeout vs. win by checkmate. Does this percentage change as my ELO does?", "What day of the week do I play the most chess?" etc...

Sidenote: My ELO is a work in progress. 

### Scrape 

First the scraper starts by logging into the site. It enters my username and password and clicks login.
